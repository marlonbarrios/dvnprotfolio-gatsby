## About

(this is shirt version)


I love film. I have worked on almost every aspect of production, including writing, creating shot-lists, gathering crew, casting, lights, sound, cinematography, acting and editing. I can honestly say I love every aspect of working on set, I’m always learning more about different ways of doing lighting or sound or camerawork, and it helps me be a more efficient part of any team I’m working on regardless of my role. 

I graduated from Hampshire College in 2020 with a Bachelors of Arts focused on Religious and Spiritual Studies and Filmmaking. I had always loved film since I was a teenager, but I decided in College to pursue a swath of different disciplines, including philosophy, dance, religion, natural sciences, and spanish. For my final project, I decided to create a narrative film based on my very personal experiences at and outside of Hampshire College.
